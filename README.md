# CodeQuiz

The overall idea of this project is to test my knowledge on Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

For this project, I was required to create a coding quiz using Javascript. The quiz app will run in the browser and work as follows:

On opening the page, the user will be shown a screen with some basic information and a start button.

Upon clicking the button, the screen will show the first multiple choice questions and the timer will start counting down from 20 seconds.

For each question, if the user clicks the correct answer, their score will increment. 

Once the timer ends OR all the questions have been displayed, the screen will display the "Game over" message.
